This example demonstrates the functions `get_variables`, `get_data` and
`plot_data` which are included in `censusnz`.

```{r, include = FALSE}
pkgload::load_all(export_all=FALSE, helpers=FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(censusnz)
```

Let's say we want to investigate smoking and employment statistics, but we
aren't sure which geographical level to investigate at. We can begin by using 
`get_variables` to check what variables are available, and to take note of their
exact names.

```{r}
vars <- get_variables()
relevant_vars <- vars %>% 
  dplyr::filter(grepl("employment", variable, fixed = TRUE) |
                  grepl("smoking", variable, fixed = TRUE))
relevant_vars
```

It seems we have variables `status_in_employment` and `smoking_status` as
expected, and we have these variables for a range of geographical levels. To
select a geographical level, consider the breakdown of their relationships from
Stats NZ.

We can also compare with the codes for the available regions.

```{r}
vars$geography %>% unique()
```

We can match most of these with their respective blocks on the diagram. Let's
say we are interested in the most general geographical level available, `SA1`.
We construct our first call to `get_data()`.

```{r}
my_data <- get_data(geography = "SA1",
                    variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"))
my_data
```

This is our first look at an output from `get_data()`. We have the columns we
would expect, such as `variable` and `count`, as well as `variable_group` which 
describes various groupings of individuals by their answers to census questions.
We also have some extra columns:

|Variable   |Description                                                                    |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`geoid`    |A unique ID for the geographical unit based on the area hierarchy              |
|`land_type`|The land type, e.g. "Mainland", "Inlet", "Island", "Mixture"                   |
|`name`     |A name for the geographical unit if available. More informative at lower levels|

In this case `SA1` units do not have informative names so the `geoid` and `name`
columns are identical.

Maybe instead of `SA1`, we try plotting the data by `RC` unit, for Regional Councils.

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
plot_data(geography = "RC", variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"))
```

By default this plots the 6 regions with the highest count. However, `plot_data`
has additional arguments to customise this output. For example:

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.height =7, fig.width = 7}
plot_data(geography = "RC",
          variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"),
          n = 4,
          exclude_other = TRUE,
          exclude_total = FALSE)
```

`exclude_total` removes the Total NZ category if it exists and `exclude_other` 
ignores lumping of categories into "other". When we set `exclude_other` and
`exclude_total` to FALSE, we now have these extra categories included in our output.

With these set to FALSE we can see that Total NZ has the highest counts, which
is expected. Auckland Region is the largest single region by count, and 'Other'
encompasses all remaining regions. The counts for Auckland and Other should add
to the same as Total NZ.

Note that using `exclude_total = FALSE` often introduces issues with the scale
of smaller regions on the same plot. Using `plot_relative` can be helpful to
address this.

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.height =7, fig.width = 7}
plot_relative(geography = "RC",
              variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"),
              n = 4,
              exclude_other = TRUE,
              exclude_total = FALSE)
```

We can also make several general observations about individuals 15 years and 
over:

* Most individuals have never smoked
* There are slightly more ex-smokers than regular smokers
* The vast majority of individuals are employed
* More individuals are self-employed without employees than are employers
* There are relatively very small numbers of individuals who are unpaid family
workers or not elsewhere included

We can investigate this final point further:

```{r}
my_data_RC <- get_data(geography = "RC", variables = "status_in_employment")
vargroup_summary <- my_data_RC[my_data_RC$name == "Total NZ (Regional Council)", c("variable_group", "count")] %>%
  dplyr::group_by(variable_group) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(n = sum(count), .groups = "drop_last")
vargroup_summary[order(vargroup_summary$n), ]
```

Plot relative is also helpful for direct comparison, using the `regions`
argument.

```{r fig.align = 'center', fig.height =7, fig.width = 7}
plot_relative(geography = "RC",
              variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"),
              regions = c("Auckland Region", "Wellington Region"),
              position = "fill")

plot_relative(geography = "RC",
              variables = c("status_in_employment", "smoking_status"),
              regions = c("Auckland Region", "Wellington Region"),
              position = "dodge")
```

We can see that Auckland region has a higher proportion of individuals who have
never smoked than Wellington, and Wellington has far more ex-smokers. However, 
Auckland and Wellington have very similar compositions of employment status.
